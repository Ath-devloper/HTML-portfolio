<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! I'm Atharv Pahdatre, a Computer Science student at Moze College of Engineering, Pune. I'm passionate about technology and have recently dived into the world of web development. Currently, I'm working on my first-ever web page using HTML, and I couldn't be more excited! This project is just the beginning of what I hope will be a long and fulfilling journey in web development. I'm eager to learn, experiment, and create something truly amazing as I explore the endless possibilities of the web.</p>
